# bslib - battery storage library
bslib is a tool that provides a set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy storing systems. openBatLib was originally ported from the PerMod MATLAB toolbox developed at HTW Berlin and it implements many of the models and methods developed at the Labs. More information on
